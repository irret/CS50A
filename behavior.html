            Axolotls are quite gentle and they are fascinating creatures because of their mystique appearance, regeneration properties and neotenic nature. Unlike other amphibians, it remains in larval form throughout the life without undergoing metamorphosis. Larval structures that are found in adult axolotls are the gills and fins. In fact, they reach sexual maturity during their larval stage which is also described as perennibranchiate state. Axolotls are aquatic but they also have rudimentary lungs. Neoteny is an interesting concept in amphibian’s life because it is actually backward step in evolution. Certain environmental conditions are thought to be related with it particularly low levels of iodine and random genetic mutation. Some researchers also thought that extremely low temperature may also influence neoteny as it suppresses the hormone production.
