            My name is Teresa Gutierrez. I'm an SRJC student who is pursuing a career in Web Development. I find Web Development rewarding in more ways than one. It requires both creativity and analytical thinking; both aspects of which I enjoy. The process of building the structure and making the web page come to life with styling is fun for me. Although I have gone through multiple HTML and CSS tutorials, this is my first Web Development class.

            In my opinion the hardest part of this project was coming up with the design of the web page. I spent a lot of time testing different combinations of color, font, images, and position of the elements. It was a bit of trial and error. Some combinations that I thought would go well just didn’t look right on the page. What I found most surprising about my animal is its power to regenerate full limbs, and other vital organs such as the heart and brain. That’s a super power I’d like to have.</p>

        <p class="centerText">Thanks for stopping by!</p>
