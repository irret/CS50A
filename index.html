            The <strong>axolotl</strong> also known as a <strong>Mexican salamander</strong> <em>(Ambystoma mexicanum)</em> or a <strong>Mexican walking fish</strong>, is a neotenic salamander, closely related to the tiger salamander. Although the axolotl is colloquially known as a "walking fish", it is not a fish, but an amphibian. The species originates from numerous lakes, such as Lake Xochimilco underlying Mexico City. Axolotls are unusual among amphibians in that they reach adulthood without undergoing metamorphosis. Instead of developing lungs and taking to the land, adults remain aquatic and gilled.

        <h2>Healing Abilities</h2>
        <p>
            The feature of the salamander that attracts most attention is its healing ability: the axolotl does not heal by scarring and is capable of the regeneration of entire lost appendages in a period of months, and, in certain cases, more vital structures. Some have indeed been found restoring the less vital parts of their brains. They can also readily accept transplants from other individuals, including eyes and parts of the brainâ€”restoring these alien organs to full functionality. In some cases, axolotls have been known to repair a damaged limb, as well as regenerating an additional one, ending up with an extra appendage that makes them attractive to pet owners as a novelty. In metamorphosed individuals, however, the ability to regenerate is greatly diminished. The axolotl is therefore used as a model for the development of limbs in vertebrates.
        </p>
        <h2>Endangered Species</h2>
        <h3>As of 2010, wild axolotls were near extinction due to:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Urbanization</li>
            <li>Water Polution</li>
            <li>Introduction of Invesice Species</li>
            <li>Scientific Research</li>
            <li>Being Sold as Food</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Surveys in 1998, 2003, and 2008 found 6,000, 1,000, and 100 axolotls per square kilometer in its Lake Xochimilco habitat, respectively. A four-month-long search in 2013, however, turned up no surviving individuals in the wild. Just a month later, two wild ones were spotted in a network of canals leading from Xochimilco. The city is currently working on conserving axolotls by building "axolotl shelters" and conserving remaining and potential habitats for the salamanders.</p>
